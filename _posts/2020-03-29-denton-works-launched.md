Denton.works just recently launched as a hopeful resource to help connect invidivuals who have been impacted by the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this website is to serve as a hyper local job board, separate from any main stream or cost incurring job posting service like LinkedIn or Indeed. While those services should definitely be utilized for job seekers looking for new careers, this website is meant to be catered specifically to those individuals and companies in Denton who need a more direct connection.

## Open Source
As members of communities across the nation, everyone is looking for contribute in some way. Whether you're delivering groceries for your elderly neighbors, sewing N95 masks to help address the nationwide shortage, or even just staying inside and keeping up the moral with your friends and family - everyone wants to do their part.

As a group of professional developers and general technologists, TechMill has created this job board as an open source option that can be freely copied and repurposed for any community to utilize for the same goal. It is meant to be as low tech as possible, without incurring any kind of cost to host or build (other than some volunteer time to get it up and running), using free tools where available. You can find the source code of this repository on our Github organization at [https://github.com/techmilldenton/denton-works](https://github.com/techmilldenton/denton-works). Consider contributing and submitting any issues to improve its impact!
