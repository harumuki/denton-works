Between the Chamber of Commerce, Stoke, and TechMill - we’re here as local resources to support you to the best of our abilities. Below you will find a message from each of our representing partners in how we’re best suited to support you in this time of need.</p>\n<h3>Denton Chamber of Commerce</h3>\n<p>The Denton Chamber is dedicated to helping you and your business through COVID-19. And when restrictions are lifted, the Denton Chamber will continue our mission to “Advocate, Educate and Collaborate for Economic Growth in Denton.” A robust, connected Denton workforce will help accomplish that mission while increasing Denton’s ability to attract and sustain growth.</p>\n<h3>Stoke Coworking</h3>\n<p>On March 25th when Denton County entered the “Stay at Home” order, Stoke was forced to shut our doors. Even though Stoke is closed, we are committed to providing support, connection, and resources to our members and to the Denton community and keeping our team employed.</p>\n<p>Our team continues to provide value to our members through hosting weekly virtual happy hours, twice a month member huddles, and daily work sprints to provide accountability and maintain productivity while folks are working from home. We are also offering free mail forwarding services to any members who need it. We are still accepting new members and encourage anyone who is in need of accountability or a sense of community while working from home to consider joining us as a <a href=\"http://members.stokedenton.com\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual member</a>.</p>\n<p>We continue to hold events virtually that are free and open to the public to connect people with knowledge and resources that they may need during this trying time; we just ask that you register via Eventbrite to receive the Zoom link to call in. You can stay up-to-date on our events by signing up for our newsletter or visiting our <a href=\"http://stokedenton.com\" target=\"_blank\">events page</a>. We are hosting weekly Coffee + Convo calls that are led by Stoke mentors, and subjects range from pivoting your business to maintaining a side hustle. We also hosted a panel discussion on the CARES act with a few local experts to try to navigate and understand the details of the stimulus package. You can see recordings of these events on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hgMsyWEFymJ4sb-eGaRcQ?view_as=subscriber\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>We compiled a list of resources that we continue to add to as more information comes online. You can read blogs about healthy work habits, find links to local resources and grant funds, and <a href=\"https://stokedenton.com/covid19-community-support\" target=\"_blank\">more</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, we know that we will be closed through the month of April due to the Governor’s order that non-essential businesses be closed. Regardless, we remain committed to cultivating community and empowering entrepreneurs by providing support, events, programs, and opportunities to connect both to our members and to the Denton business community as a whole.</p>\n<h3>TechMill Denton</h3>\n<p>Most of you might not know this, but TechMill’s board members are made up entirely of volunteers by night and who are tech professionals by day, ranging from engineers, data scientists, teachers, and freelancers. As TechMill’s mission is to support the local Denton tech and startup community through education and networking events, we’re committed to providing channels for individuals to connect with other tech professionals, ask questions, embark on personal growth projects, and support you in your continuous tech education journey.</p>\n<p>TechMill works very closely with our community partners at Stoke, so if you are interested in learning a technical topic, whether it be broad or niche, don’t esitate to reach out and we would be happy to organize a free, online public training session around it. You can contact us directly at <a href=\"mailto:info@techmill.co?subject=TechMill Training Session\">info@techmill.co</a>, or contact Stoke and we’ll always stay in contact.</p>\n<p>Stay healthy, stay safe, and never give up in a journey towards self-improvement.</p>","excerpt":"Whether you’re looking for work or looking to hire - Denton has a number of resources available to you.
