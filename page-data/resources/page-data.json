Even though Stoke is closed, we are committed to providing support, connection, and resources to our members and to the Denton community and keeping our team employed.</p>\n<p>Our team continues to provide value to our members through hosting weekly virtual happy hours, twice a month member huddles, and daily work sprints to provide accountability and maintain productivity while folks are working from home. We are also offering free mail forwarding services to any members who need it. We are still accepting new members and encourage anyone who is in need of accountability or a sense of community while working from home to consider joining us as a <a href=\"http://members.stokedenton.com\" target=\"_blank\">Virtual member</a>.</p>\n<p>We continue to hold events virtually that are free and open to the public to connect people with knowledge and resources that they may need during this trying time; we just ask that you register via Eventbrite to receive the Zoom link to call in. You can stay up-to-date on our events by signing up for our newsletter or visiting our <a href=\"http://stokedenton.com\" target=\"_blank\">events page</a>. We are hosting weekly Coffee + Convo calls that are led by Stoke mentors, and subjects range from pivoting your business to maintaining a side hustle. We also hosted a panel discussion on the CARES act with a few local experts to try to navigate and understand the details of the stimulus package. You can see recordings of these events on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hgMsyWEFymJ4sb-eGaRcQ?view_as=subscriber\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>We compiled a list of resources that we continue to add to as more information comes online. You can read blogs about healthy work habits, find links to local resources and grant funds, and <a href=\"https://stokedenton.com/covid19-community-support\" target=\"_blank\">more</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, we know that we will be closed through the month of April due to the Governor’s order that non-essential businesses be closed. Regardless, we remain committed to cultivating community and empowering entrepreneurs by providing support, events, programs, and opportunities to connect both to our members and to the Denton business community as a whole.</p>\n<h2>A message from TechMill</h2>\n<p>content here</p>","excerpt":"Whether you’re looking for work or looking to hire - Denton has a number of resources available to you.
