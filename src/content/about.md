Denton.works is a community resource developed in partnership by TechMill, Stoke, and the Denton Chamber of Commerce to help connect job seekers with those that have jobs available in the Denton, Texas area. This is a platform to help facilitate connections between employers and employees, but all communications will happen independently.
